# HackPrague 2020 - eReceipt

## Description

This project deals with storing receipts in a virtual environment effortlessly, because the whole process is automated.
Saving a receipt in a virtual environment solves a lot of problems and worries with physical receipts. You can filter
them according to various criteria, search for purchased items in them, you will receive a notification at the end of
the warranty, but most importantly you cannot lose or damage them. You can filter results based on price range, category
of purchased goods, date of purchase, end of warranty period, merchant, method of payment or warranty status. There is
also the option to use the search box. When clicking on the receipt, the user will see, in addition to the purchased
items and their quantity, all other details of the receipt, such as VAT, merchant and his data (ICO, DIC), date of
purchase, method of payment, payment registration method and of course BKP and FIK (or PKP). The application also
contains product recommendations based on previous purchases or spending on services. Furthermore, we can also find
statistics in the application not only about expenses, but also about saved paper. In addition, the entire process of
assigning receipts to an account is anonymized, so no one can find out who the receipts belong to until the user
requests their assigning to his account.

## FAQ

### How does the project you did within HackPrague 2020 contribute to the change you would like to make in FinTech area?

If our project took hold, it would mean a big change in retail and this outdated and environmentally demanding way of
reporting payments would disappear.

### How do you plan to continue with this project?

Of course, everyone will have the question of how the data will be obtained automatically. This will be done directly
in the store by connecting the cash register supporting EET to our system through a system administrator (for example
Redeggs company). Furthermore, we would like to connect banks with our system, which would gain access (of course with
the user's consent) not only to the stores where users buy, but also to the individual items they buy. This will give
banks the opportunity for a greater degree of individualization of Internet banking, as well as their services.

### What did this HackPrague hackathon, and the connection with Seed Starter brought you?

Participation in this hackathon broadened our horizons in the field of fintech and helped us to meet new people not only
from the private sector, but also from the government, who consulted with us on our project from various perspectives.
